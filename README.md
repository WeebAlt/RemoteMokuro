# Using Mokuro Remotely

The goal is to read Japanese manga with selectable text without any local storage or processing.

## First - Using Mokuro
Mokuro's Github: https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro
<br>Get their demo to run for the following file structure:
```
manga
     |----<manga title>
              |----<volume folder containing images>
```
